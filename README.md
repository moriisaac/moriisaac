# 👋 Hi, I'm Mori Wesonga  
### Cloud Architect | DevOps Engineer | AWS | Kubernetes | Python | Scalable Systems  

🚀 I’m a Cloud Architect and DevOps Engineer focused on **building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud-native systems**.  
I specialize in **AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Python automation**, with a deep interest in **observability, CI/CD, and cost optimization** across multi-environment deployments.

---

## 🧩 What I Do

- 🌐 **Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**  
  Architecting scalable multi-environment systems on **AWS + Kubernetes** using **Terraform/OpenTofu** and GitOps principles.

- ⚙️ **DevOps & Automation**  
  Building **CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD)** for automated, zero-downtime deployments.

- 🧮 **Cost Optimization & Observability**  
  Reducing cloud spend through **Spot/On-Demand orchestration**, autoscaling (KEDA, CA), and complete observability stacks (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki).

- 🛡️ **Security & Zero-Trust Networking**  
  Implementing **Okta-backed SSO, Tailscale VPN access**, and internal DNS routing to enforce least-privilege access across environments.
